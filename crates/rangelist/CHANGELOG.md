# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.1] - 2025-08-13

### Fixed

- Fix a regression where `DiffIter` did not always correctly handle when two lhs
  ranges must be cut by the same rhs range.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-08-12

### Added

- Add `RangeList::position`, `RangeList::first_position_bound`, and
  `RangeList::last_position_bound` methods to aid in searching for the position of
  an element in a `RangeList`.
- Add `DiscreteElement` trait to be able to treat certain elements as distinct
  and enumerable, such as for example integers. This replaces the need for the
  `castaway` and `num` dependencies.

### Changed

- `RangeList::contains` is now implemented as part of the `IntervalIterator` trait.
- `RangeList::card` now returns an `Option<usize>` and is marked `None` when the
  cardinality overflows `usize`.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-08-12

### Changed

- `IntervalIter` is now named `IntervalIterator`.

### Removed

- `IntervalIterator<Item = E>` is no longer automatically implemented for all
  types that implement `IntoIterator<Item = RangeIncluise<E>>`.

### Added

- Add `diff` operation for types that implement `IntervalIterator` over integer
  types.
- Implement `IntervalIterator` for `HashSet` and `BTreeSet` from
  `std::collections`.
- Add `DiffIter`, `IntersectIter`, and `UnionIter` to provide lazy evaluation of
  set operations.

## [0.1.0] - 2024-07-05

### Added

- Add initial implementation of `RangeList` type.
- Add `IntervalIter` trait for types that can output a iterator of sorted
  intervals and implement it for `RangeList`.
- Add set operations `card`, `disjoint`, `intersect`, `subset`, `superset`,
  `union` for implementers of `IntervalIter`.
